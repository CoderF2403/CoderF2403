- **DATA WRANGLNG PROJECT**

  https://github.com/CoderF2403/Data-Wrangling-UNICEF
  
  This script is used to intake the male survey data from UNICEF and save it to a simple csv file
  (or a MySQL Database if wished) after it has been checked for duplicates and missing data and after the headers 
  have been properly matched with the data.
  
  It expects there to be a 'mn.csv' file with the data and the 'mn_headers_updated.csv' file in a sub-folder called 
  'unicef' within a data folder in this directory. It also expects there to be a MySql database called datawrangling.
  Finally, it expects to utilize the dataset library (http://dataset.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
  
  If the script runs without finding any errors, it will save the cleaned data to the 'unicef_survey' folder in the MySQL 
  or if wished can be saved into 'Data Files'.
